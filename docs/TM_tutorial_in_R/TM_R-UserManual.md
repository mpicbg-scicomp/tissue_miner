# TissueMiner: an R-tutorial to visualize cell dynamics in 2D tissues

# Introduction to TissueMiner

* **Prerequisite:** it is assumed in this tutorial that 
    + time-lapses have been processed using the TissueMiner automated workflow [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner)

* **We provide three processed time-lapses** corresponding to the distal part of 3 wild-type *Drosophila* pupal wings. [Please, download them here](https://cloud.mpi-cbg.de/index.php/s/XF5swEw9lxRmZNj). 

* **No programming skill required:** the tutorial [Learning_the_R_basics_for_TissueMiner]() will guide the user, without any previous knowledge in programming, through the main aspects of data manipulation and visualization using the R language. 

* **The power of an existing grammar** to manipulate and to visualize data. The open-source R language now provides very efficient and simple ways to handle important amount of tabular data, using a so called "grammar" of data manipulation (*dplyr* package) and visualization (*ggplot2* package) (ref Wickham). We found R to be ideal for querying our relational databases (*RSQLite* package), and to perform subsequent calculations and analyses for understanding tissue morphogenesis. Thus, the user keeps control of his data by learning a few verbs and the simple syntax of the grammar. This gives the advantage of full autonomy on the data that can manipulated without restriction. 

* **TissueMiner extends this grammar** to facilitate the visualization and quantification of cell dynamics during tissue morphogenesis

* **TissueMiner is compatible with the Python programming language**. We provide a Python-tutorial of TissueMiner [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/tree/master/docs)

* **High performance computing platform**. TissueMiner has been designed to be used in command-line in order to easily batch repetitive tasks and to run tasks on a high performance computing platform (cluster). 

* **A comprehensive HOWTO**. This tutorial progressively introduces the techniques of data manipulation and visualization for the user to learn how to master them. It is also organized as an *HOWTO* to visualize and quantify cell dynamics in 2D tissues, by a simple copy-paste of the code encapsulated in shaded grey boxes into a R-shell such as in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). We strongly encourage the user to use RStudio or a similar software to conveniently run the R programs provide in TissueMiner.

* **TissueMiner can easily be extended** by the user to address project-specific questions

* **Tutorial layout**: the code is encapsulated in shaded grey boxes that delimit **code chunks**. The **results** are displayed immediately below in an open box in which all lines start with the ## sign. Within code chunks, **comments** are visible in green and are prefixed with at least a # sign. The comments indicate what the following code does. Here is an example:


```r
# This is a comment: the code below will print "Welcome to TissueMiner"
print("Welcome to TissueMiner")
```

```
## [1] "Welcome to TissueMiner"
```

## TissueMiner "snakemake" automated workflow

### Strengths
* The _snakemake_ automated workflow (sm command) builds the **database** and generates **useful data** about cell lineages, cell topology, cell geometry, and cell contributions to tissue deformation. 
* You can run the workflow step by step by mean of "rules" that we defined in the snakemake configuration [file](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/workflow/tm.snkmk). Based on this configuration file, the snakemake engine checks if all necessary inputs are present before running a given step. If inputs are missing the snakemake engine runs the missing steps automatically.

### Limitations
* Data manipulation and visualization strategies shouldn't be modified within this workflow to avoid breaking the workflow. 

### To overcome the limitations: an Application programming interface
* This present User Manual guides the user through the _Application programming interface (API)_ that we developed in TissueMiner to **customize data visualization**.

### What are the data generated by the "snakemake" automated workflow ?
* Here is a list of important files that are generated by the complete automated workflow
    + The database: **(\<movie_name\>.sqlite)**
    + An extra table **(cellshapes.RData)** to represent cell contours by using anticlockwisely ordered cell vertices
    + An extra table **(./roi_bt/lgRoiSmoothed.RData)** to store cells in user-defined regions of interest
    + An extra table **(./topochanges/t1DataFilt.RData)** to store cell neighbor changes
    + An extra table **(./shear_contrib/triangles.RData)** to store triangles
    + Extra tables **(./shear_contrib/\<ROI_name\>/avgDeformTensorsWide.RData)** to store the calculated pure shear deformation of triangles and tissue for each region of interest
        
### Select specific rules to run part of the "snakemake" automated workflow
* A graph represents the order and the relations between rules (tasks) to be run. You can see such a graph in Figure 7 of the [resource paper]()
* Command to run the complete workflow including video creation: `sm all`
* Command to see all non-processed rules: `sm -n`
* Command to build the database only: `sm make_db`
* Command to generate the necessary data for exploiting the TissueMiner API: to be defined



## Beyond the automated workflow: now, make your own scripts

### Requirements

* **Ubuntu:** you may install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or another integrated environment for R programming. The TissueMiner API has already been installed and configured during the installation procedure.

* **MacOS:** we provide a TissueMiner API installer that includes an Rstudio installation
Run this in a Terminal:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install git
export TM_HOME="${HOME}/tissue_miner"
git clone https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner.git ${TM_HOME}
${TM_HOME}/installation/osx/install_tm_api.sh
```

* **Any systems with the Docker toolbox:** you can use the Rstudio server from the provided docker image that includes all necessary R packages
    + go to https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner
    + download the TissueMiner API (in your home folder): click 'Download ZIP' 
    + unzip the file
    + open a docker terminal and start the rstudio server with the following commands


```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e USER=rstudio -e PASSWORD=rstudio \
-v $HOME:/home/rstudio/share \
etournay/tissue_miner
```
*    + get the URL to reach the Rstudio server 

```bash
echo "http://$(docker-machine ip default):8787"
```
*    + **Copy and paste the resulting URL onto a web browser:** login: rstudio, password: rstudio

### TissueMiner configuration

* We provide two configuration files to setup the global environement: default_config.R and flywing_tm_config.R that you can find [here]()
    + define graphics theme
    + define a common color scheme for known quantities. Ex: color of shear curves
    + define time offsets for comparing multiple movies in time, using the `algnModel` variable
    + define a time offset to display the developmental time. Ex: 54000 seconds for 16 hAPF
    + define default parameters. Ex: movie grid size, default ROI name, ...  


* Configure Rstudio to run examples of the present User Manual
    + Ubuntu, Linux and MacOS

```bash
# To define the location of TissueMiner scripts and configuration file, just open a terminal and type in:
echo "TM_HOME=~/tissue_miner" >> ~/.Renviron
echo "TM_CONFIG=~/tissue_miner/config/flywing_tm_config.R" >> ~/.Renviron
```
*    + Windows

```bash
# On Windows, TM_HOME and TM_CONFIG must be defined in the .Renviron file.
# Jut type in: help("Startup") in a R session (Rstudio), and follow the manual
```

* Configure Rstudio to run your own scripts
    + You may use the default configuration 

```bash
# To define the location of TissueMiner scripts and configuration file, just open a terminal and type in:
echo "TM_HOME=~/tissue_miner" >> ~/.Renviron
echo "TM_CONFIG=~/tissue_miner/config/default_config.R" >> ~/.Renviron
```
*    + You may create your own configuration file

```bash
# To define the location of TissueMiner scripts and configuration file, just open a terminal and type in:
echo "TM_HOME=~/tissue_miner" >> ~/.Renviron

# Here provide the path to your configuration file
echo "TM_CONFIG=path_to_my_config_file" >> ~/.Renviron
```

    
### Your first script: load TissueMiner routines in Rstudio
* **Please modify the paths (first chunk below) according to your data location**
* **Always execute the code below before running the analysis**

***


```r
# Define path to all processed movies: TO BE EDITED BY THE USER
movieDbBaseDir="/Users/retourna/example_data/"

# Define a working directory where to save the analysis: TO BE EDITED BY THE USER
outDataBaseDir="/tmp/output"
```

***


```r
# Set up path to the TissueMiner code
# This command requires that the global environment TM_HOME is defined in the .bash_profile
scriptsDir=Sys.getenv("TM_HOME")

# Load TissueMiner libraries
source(file.path(scriptsDir, "commons/TMCommons.R"))
source(file.path(scriptsDir, "commons/BaseQueryFunctions.R"))
source(file.path(scriptsDir, "commons/TimeFunctions.R"))
source(file.path(scriptsDir, "config/flywing_tm_config.R"))

# Set up working directory
mcdir(outDataBaseDir)
```



* TissueMiner extends the existing grammars in R for visualizing and quantifying cell dynamics in 2D-living tissues:

Functions | Description | Project
--------------|-------------|-------------
**print_head** | head the current table with the row number | TissueMiner
**dt.merge** | fast merging of two dataframes, possibility to suffix column names | TissueMiner
**openMovieDb** | open a connection to a movie database | TissueMiner
**multi_db_query** | aggregate data into one dataframe | TissueMiner
**coarseGrid** | assign grid elements to cell positions | TissueMiner
**smooth_tissue** | average quantities in time using a moving window | TissueMiner
**align_movie_start** | align movies at earliest common developmental time | TissueMiner
**chunk_time_into_intervals** | undersample time for local time averaging | TissueMiner
**synchronize_frames** | find closest frame to user-defined time intervals | TissueMiner
**mqf_* functions** | set of multi-query functions to quantify cell dynamics | TissueMiner

The mqf functions constitute an important part of the TissueMiner API. They will be discribed thereafter.

## How to query a relational database ?

### Open a connection to the database

* Database format: SQLite
* Open a connection to one database: **openMovieDb()** function using the RSQLite package
* The name of the time-lapse is used to identify the corresponding database
* The SQLite connection is assigned to a variable called "db".



```r
# Define path a particular time-lapse called "demo"
movieDir <- file.path(movieDbBaseDir, c("demo"))

# Connection to the DB stored in the "db" variable
db <- openMovieDb(movieDir)
```


```r
# Close the connection
dbDisconnect(db)
```

### Example: overlay cells and vertices on the image

We can now overlay cells and vertices on the wing image. To do so, we built a dedicated **render_frame()** function that loads the specified frame of the time-lapse. This function takes the cell contour table and a desired frame as input variables. The **render_frame()** function returns the first layers of the graph that consists of a raster image of the wing and additional specifications such as the Y-axis flipping - **scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse")** - and the iso-scaling of the X and Y axes - **coord_equal()**. 




```r
cellshapes <- locload(file.path(movieDir, "cellshapes.RData")) %>% print_head()
```

```
## Source: local data frame [6 x 5]
## 
##   frame cell_id x_pos y_pos bond_order
##   (int)   (int) (dbl) (dbl)      (dbl)
## 1     0   10001   193   195          1
## 2     0   10001   189   199          2
## 3     0   10001   206   212          3
## 4     0   10001   229   206          4
## 5     0   10001   219   192          5
## 6     0   10001   217   190          6
## [1] 219714
```

```r
# Plot cells and vertices on the original image
cellshapes %>%
  # add overlay image (! connection to DB required !):
  render_frame(50) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x_pos, y_pos, group=cell_id), color="green",fill=NA, size=0.2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x_pos, y_pos),color="red", size=0.4) +
  ggtitle("Cells and vertices overlaid on the image")
```

## Working with regions of interest (ROIs)

* By default TissueMiner creates two regions of interest:
    + **raw**: this ROI corresponds to all tracked cells contained in the DB
    + **whole_tissue**: this ROI corresponds to the largest population of cells that is visible throughout the movie. It's a subset of **raw** obtained by the lineage-browser algorithm that is part of the automated workflow of TissueMiner

* Other regions of interest can be manually defined by the user in Fiji ([see Fiji macro](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/fiji_macros/draw_n_get_ROIcoord.ijm)). Of note, these additional ROIs are only taken into account if they were defined **before** running the automated workflow.  

The automated workflow includes routines to browse the cell lineage and to follow ROIs in time once defined on a given image of the time-lapse. Please note that cells in contact with the margin are discarded because the segmentation and tracking quality isn't optimum near the margin.

**Example: Visualize cells in a selected ROI**

```r
# Load tracked ROIs: 
lgRoiSmoothed <- locload(file.path(movieDir, "roi_bt/lgRoiSmoothed.RData")) %>%
  print_head() %>%
  filter(roi %in% c("cell_patch")) 
```

```
##          roi cell_id
## 1 cell_patch   10104
## 2 cell_patch   10110
## 3 cell_patch   10111
## 4 cell_patch   10112
## 5 cell_patch   10114
## 6 cell_patch   10116
## [1] 515
```

```r
# Load cell shapes for plotting on the wing
cellshapes <- locload(file.path(movieDir, "cellshapes.RData"))

# Merge ROI with cell polygonal definition
cellshapesWithRoi <- cellshapes %>%
  dt.merge(lgRoiSmoothed, by="cell_id", allow.cartesian=T) %>%
  arrange(frame, cell_id, bond_order) ## .. because merge messes up the ordering

# Plot  ROI on the wing
render_frame(cellshapesWithRoi, 50) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x_pos, y_pos, fill=roi, group=cell_id), alpha=0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("cell_patch"="darkgreen"))
```

## Make videos 
**Videos are helpful to visualize the time evolution of patterns**

Here, we use a parallelized loop over all frames of the time-lapse. The well-known avconv (formerly ffmpeg) program to create videos must be installed on your computer, please, visit [http://ffmpegmac.net/](http://ffmpegmac.net/) for Mac users or simply "sudo apt-get install libav-tools" on Ubuntu-Linux. 

* To simplify the procedure of creating videos, we built a dedicated function **render_movie()** that takes a list of ggplot layers as an input argument.
* Please, read the current definition of the **render_movie()** function [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/commons/MovieFunctions.R).

```r
# Make a video of the ROI on the wing
render_movie(cellshapesWithRoi, "bt_bhfix_peeled.mp4", list(
          geom_polygon(aes(x_pos, y_pos, fill=roi, group=cell_id),  alpha=0.5),
          scale_fill_manual(values=c("cell_patch"="darkgreen"))))
```

## A TissueMiner library to visualize cell dynamics

TissueMiner provide a set of tools to quantify and visualize cell dynamics at different spatial scales.
These tools are all prefixed with 'mqf' as they perform multiple queries to the pre-processed data obtained with the TissueMiner automated workflow. Their common features are:

* aggregate data from one selected movie into a dataframe for immediate visualization
* include ROI definitions
* include developmental time

Mandatory argument: a path to a selected movie directory

Optional arguments: to control selected ROIs and other parameters that are specific to some subsets of mqf functions

### Fine-grained analyses

* mqf_fg_* functions generate fine-grained data (cellular scale) that
    + are mapped to all ROIs by default
    + include bond, cell or triangle contours for plotting
    + perform an automatic scaling of nematics for an optimal display on the original image

mqf_fg_* functions | Description 
--------------|-------------
***mqf_fg_nematics_cell_elong*** | get cell elongation nematics from the DB

***

### Coarse-grained analyses: per frame and by ROIs

* The **mqf_cg_roi_* functions**:
    + perform spatial (by ROI) and temporal (kernSize option) averaging of quantities
    + perform an automatic scaling of nematics for an optimal display on the original image

mqf_cg_roi_* functions | Description 
--------------|-------------|-------------
***mqf_cg_roi_cell_count*** | count cell number

# Visualize patterned cell behaviors on the tissue

## Bond length pattern

To render cell bonds one must get bonds and their respective positions. Here, is an example in which different related tables must be joined together to pool the relevant data to be plotted:

* 3 connected tables from the relational database to be considered: **bonds**, **directed_bonds** and **vertices**
* By joining those 3 tables one can generate a new table containing the bonds with their respective vertices and length
* A bond is represented by drawing a segment between its two vertices
* Bond length is mapped onto a color gradient scale for a color-coded visualization


For the sake of clarity, we built a dedicated **mqf_fg_bond_length()** function to get bond properties along with bond positions for plotting. Please, read its definition [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/commons/BaseQueryFunctions.R).

## Cell area 

### Get and manipulate the data for plotting

* Using the **TissueMiner grammar**, one can get all cell properties and cell contours in one step

```r
cellArea <- mqf_fg_cell_area(movieDir, rois = c("raw"), cellContour = T)
```

* **Alternatively**, one can do each step separately. Here, we don't add ROI definition (faster).


```r
# Send a SQL query to get cell area in each frame
cellArea <- dbGetQuery(db,"select cell_id, frame, area from cells where cell_id!=10000") %>%
  # add cell polygons into it
  dt.merge(locload(file.path(movieDir, "cellshapes.RData")),
           by = c("frame", "cell_id")) %>%
  # order vertices around the cell contour for ploting cells as polygons
  arrange(cell_id, frame, bond_order) 
```

***

### Plot the color-coded cell area pattern

```r
cellArea %>%
  render_frame(50) + 
  # we now map cell area values to a color palette: fill=area
  geom_polygon(aes(x_pos, y_pos, group=cell_id, fill=area), alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name="area (px)",
                       colours=c("black", "blue", "green", "yellow", "red"),
                       limits=c(0,quantile(cellArea$area, probs = 99.9/100)),
                       na.value = "red") +
  ggtitle("Cell area pattern")
```

### Make a video of the cell area pattern

```r
render_movie(cellArea, "CellAreaPattern.mp4", list(
  geom_polygon(aes(x_pos, y_pos, group=cell_id, fill=area)),

## Cell elongation (nematic norm)

### Get and manipulate the data for plotting

* Using the **TissueMiner grammar**, one can get all cell properties and cell contours in one step


```r

* **Alternatively**, one can do each step separately. This way, one can easily filter desired cell properties


```r
# Send a SQL query to get the cell elongation tensor in each frame
cellShapesElong <- dbGetQuery(db,"select cell_id, frame, elong_xx, elong_xy from cells

## Cell elongation nematics (coarse-grained)

### Get and manipulate the data for plotting

* TissueMiner provides a **coarseGrid()** function to map cell positions to each element of a square grid. The user can find its definition [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/commons/RoiCommons.R).

* TissueMiner provides more specific routines using this **coarseGrid()** function to average nematics in space and time. Concerning cell elongtation, the **mqf_cg_grid_nematics_cell_elong()** TissueMiner function allows the user to directly get coarse-grained nematics that are automatically scaled for display on the original image. The display factor can also be manually defined.

* The **mqf_cg_grid_nematics_cell_elong()** from the TissueMiner grammar does the following:
    + it assigns grid elements to cells and get the cell elongation tensors from the database. 
    + it averages nematics in each grid element.
    + it scales nematics for display on the image (automatic scaling by default)

* Please, read the **mqf_cg_grid_nematics_cell_elong()** definition [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/commons/BaseQueryFunctions.R)

## Comparing patterns between movies

* You first need to download the 3 large datasets

**HOWTO**

* Then you need to define the path to this datasets


```r
# Define path to all processed movies: TO BE EDITED BY THE USER
movieDbBaseDir="/Users/retourna/movieDB/"
```


* The configuration file remains flywing_tm_config.R

### Movie frame synchronization

```r

# Comparing averaged quantities between movies and ROIs

## General principles:

**CAUTION**: Tissue orientation matters for nematic components. Indeed, nematic tensors are symmetric traceless tensors that are characterized by 2 components projected onto the x and y axis of the Cartesian system. In order to compare nematics amongst different time-lapse one has to make sure that the tissues have a similar orientation with respect to the x and y axes. In the workflow, one has the possibility to rotate the images along with the data [see Fiji macro](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/fiji_macros/orient_tissue.ijm) to obtain visually comparable time-lapses. 

**CAUTION**: Cumulative quantities are strongly influenced by the developmental time. Therefore, movies must be aligned in time prior to comparison between movies. We have aligned the three WT wing movies in time by aligning the peaks of their respective average cell elongation curves as a function of time. One movie is used as a reference and time shifts are applied to other movies. These time shifts must be stored in a configuration file containing the *algnModel* table as defined [here](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/tissue_miner/blob/master/config/flywing_tm_config.R).

***

### Description of the multi_db_query() function:

* To compare quantities between movies and ROi's, we built a multi_db_query() function that takes three arguments: the movies to be queried, the specific type of analysis to be performed and the ROI’s to be queried. The multi_db_query() function automatically takes into account the corrected developmental time stored in the flywing_tm_config.R file.

Usage: 

* multi_db_query(movieDirectories, queryFun = mqf_cell_count, ...)

Arguments:

* movieDirectories: a list of absolute paths to the movie directories
* queryFun: a string containing the query function for a specific type of analysis to be performed. The default is mqf_cell_count, which count the number of cells per frame in each ROIs of each selected movie.
* ...: optional argument corresponding to a list of selected ROIs. By default, all existing ROIs are selected.

Returned value:

* a dataframe
